## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
Airbnb is a platform of accommodation which match the needs of staying and of lending.
Their main source of income is fee for host. Basically, as the number of transactions between the host and the guest increases, their profit also increases.
So, It is important to their business and I expect it to be one of their KPIs.

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data from 2016 to better understand:

1. How long is the period available for lending by rooms ?
2. Is there a busy season ?
3. Are there any trends of popular rooms ?


The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 `.csv` files that provided data for project.

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@phuoccong99/mining-airbnb-dataset-2b8e4d67dc17).
